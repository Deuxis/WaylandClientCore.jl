# [ABANDONED] WaylandCore.jl
Core Wayland shared between client- and server-side functionality for Julia - connecting, passing messages, message-level types.

This was a side project I abandoned due to mounting difficulties and the realisation that bindings for the C library are simply more sensible to do at the moment. Leaving it as-is in case it helps someone.
